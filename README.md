#This is a heading 1

##This is a heading 2

This is how [a link](https://duckduckgo.com "Duck Duck Go") is embedded.

Italics uses *asterisks*.
Bold face also uses **asterisks**.
And predicatably, using the ***two together*** does as well.

_Underscores_ can also be __used__ for ___emphasis___, which is very *Perl-ish* of them.
- Coincidentally, the first Markdown editor was written in Perl.
- So it shouldn't be surprising that _there's more than one way do it_.
